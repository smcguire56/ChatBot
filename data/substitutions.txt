# This file contains Eliza's substitutions.
# It is based on the implementation here:
#    http://www.jezuk.co.uk/cgi-bin/view/software/eliza
#
# All lines that begin with a hash symbol are comments, and are ignored.
#
# This file should have the following format:
#   1. Each section of the file should begin with at least one blank line.
#   2. The next line should be a regular expression for what to substitute.
#   3. The next line should be the new text for the substitution.
#   4. After that, there should be at least one blank.
#
# Regular expressions should follow the syntax here:
#    https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax
#
# Eliza will try to match the regular expressions in the order they appear in
# this file, and stop at the first match. Thus earlier ones have precedence.
#
# Sometimes it's necessary to prevent a later regular expression replacing
# the output of an earlier one. This is facilitated by the special marker ~~.
# After all regular expressions have been completed ~~ will be deleted from
# the output automatically.
